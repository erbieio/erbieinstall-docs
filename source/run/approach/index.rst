The Approach
*******************

The significant step before spinning up your node is choosing your approach. Based on requirements and many potential possibilities,
you must select the client implementation (of both execution and consensus clients), the environment (hardware, system), and the
parameters for client settings.

To decide whether to run the software on your hardware or in the cloud depending on your demands.

You can use the startup script to start your node after preparing the environment.

When the node is running and syncing, you are ready to use it, but make sure to keep an eye on its maintenance.

Environment and Hardware
==========================

Erbie clients are able to run on consumer-grade computers and do not require any special hardware, such as mining machines.
Therefore, you have more options for deploying the node based on your demands. let us think about running a node on both a local
physical machine and a cloud server:

Hardware
------------

Erbie clients can run on your computer, laptop, server, or even a single-board computer. Although running clients on
different devices are possible, it had better use a dedicated machine to enhance its performance and underpin the security,
which can minimize the impact on your computer.

Hardware requirements differ by the client but generally are not that high since the node just needs to stay synced.

Do not confuse it with mining, which requires much more computing power. However , sync time and performance do improve with more
powerful hardware.

Minimum requirements
------------------------
-  CPU: Main frequency 2.9GHz, 4 cores or above CPU.
-  Memory: Capacity 8GB or more.
-  Hard Disk: Capacity 500GB or more.
-  Network bandwidth: 6M uplink and downlink peer-to-peer rate or higher

Before installing the client, please ensure your computer has enough resources to run it. You can find the minimum and recommended requirements below.
