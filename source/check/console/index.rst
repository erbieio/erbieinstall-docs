Erbie Script console
===============================

``Erbie`` has a built-in JavaScript console and a JavaScript API called web3js that you can use to interact with your node.

To use the script console run:

.. code::

    ./erbie attach ${ipc file path}/erbie.ipc


This console allows direct interaction with ``Erbie``. For example, running the eth.blockNumber command will print the latest known block number.
